### Glad to see you here!  
I am a full-stack developer who, thanks to my professional career, has been part of QA and IT teams, giving me a background in code quality and DevOps. This experience allows me to design and implement quality and effective solutions.

I'm always looking for and learning new technologies, that's the fun part. I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective.
